# Variables Used
## user defined variables
gender = athlete sex
height = athlete height in meters
massBody = athlete body weight

## derived variables
L_arm = total length of all the arm segments
L_upperArm = length of the upper arm (shoulder joint to elbow)
L_foreArm = length of the forearm (elbow to wrist)
L_hand = length of the hand (wrist to fingertip)

M_arm = total mass of all the arm segments
M_upperArm = length of the upper arm (shoulder joint to elbow)
M_foreArm = length of the forearm (elbow to wrist)
M_hand = length of the hand (wrist to fingertip)

## concerned variables
L_pec = anatomical insertion distance of the pectoralis major
L_lat = anatomical insertion of the latissimus dorsi

## major differentiating variables
A_pec = insertion angle of the pectoralis major when the arms are parallel to the ground
A_lat = insertion angle of the latissimus dorsi when the arms are parallel to the ground
PCSA_ratio = physiological cross-sectional area ratio (area of the latissimus dorsi / area of the pectoralis major)
these three variables are the genetic identifiers of ring specialists and favorable genetics here acutely reduce the difficulty of the iron cross

## physiological derivations
the M series variables relating the mass of the arm segments were calculated using the Zatsiorsky-Seluyanov method with predetermined B<sub>0</sub>
